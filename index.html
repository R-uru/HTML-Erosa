    <h3>About me<i class="fa fa-question"></i></h3>
    <blockquote>
        I was in 6th grade when I started to get some interest. It was about electrical. My father learned about electrical work, especially fixing televisions. He was attending school at that time, and he had a notebook of it made by him. I saw that and read it, and I learned a lot. I was so excited that even though I was in grade 6, I downloaded an application for how to do
         current work. I only have basic knowledge, not a lot. I have a friend of mine who has a good phone and asks me to cheat this application. It only started on modded apps, and then I don't realize I was getting into it and hacking wifi, rooting a phone, and customizing anything I want. Fast forward to when I was in grade 7. I started getting more interested in technology
         and when I entered eighth grade, I always dreamed of maximizing technology. I dream of making an automation to create anything I want, manipulating technology.
        But due to a lack of technology, items I only do are applicable on mobile. In 2016, I was playing Clash of Clans without a load or wifi using a VPN and tunneling. grade 12, free internet again that time in vpn, but not that fast, at least it is free. Also, Xavier Edang gained from that, so I also shared it with him. Due to a lack of a laptop, I can't maximize my skills,
         which is why I am stuck. I am also not that good at school. I only got an award and an honor when I was in Grade 12. I don't take that seriously. For me, when I was in elementary and high school, I did not like to perform well. I was bored in school because it was too easy for me. Now in college, this is what I'm waiting for, and now I am taking this more seriously.
